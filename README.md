# weblocker_python
This is just a beginer project I made while learning python.
The webblocker runs as a background process and blocks social media webites during working hours.
Make sure you make a temp host file before making changes into the original one.
Host file location for 
Windows – “C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts”
Linux – “/etc/hosts”
Mac OS X – “/private/etc/hosts”
